# AI Malaria Detection using YOLOv8 and SVM

## Project Proposal

### Introduction
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and control. This project aims to leverage advanced AI techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of malaria detection.

### Objectives
- Develop a robust malaria detection system using YOLOv8 for object detection.
- Integrate Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification to enhance detection accuracy.
- Create a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to use the detection system.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a comprehensive dataset of malaria-infected and healthy blood smear images.
2. **Preprocessing**: Perform image preprocessing to enhance the quality and consistency of the dataset.
3. **Model Development**:
    - Train a YOLOv8 model for detecting malaria parasites in blood smear images.
    - Use SVM for classifying the detected regions as infected or healthy.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the detection system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment**: Develop a user-friendly application for deploying the detection system in real-world settings.

### Expected Outcomes
- A high-accuracy malaria detection system that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.
- A comprehensive dataset and trained models that can be used for further research and development.
- A user-friendly application that can be deployed in healthcare facilities.

### Timeline
- **Month 1-2**: Data collection and preprocessing.
- **Month 3-4**: Model development and training.
- **Month 5**: Model evaluation and optimization.
- **Month 6**: Application development and deployment.


### Conclusion
This project aims to harness the power of AI to improve malaria detection, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes. By combining YOLOv8 and SVM, we expect to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in detecting malaria parasites.
