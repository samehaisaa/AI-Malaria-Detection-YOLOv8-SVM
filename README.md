# Malaria Detection Project

**This repository is my work, developed during my summer internship at the CRISTAL Lab**  
*(Research Center in Networks, Image, Systems, Architecture, and Multimedia - LR99ES25)*.  
**The project was a collaborative effort between CRISTAL Lab and the Parasitology & Mycology Lab Center at Charles Nicole Hospital, Tunisia.**

## Technical Report
A detailed technical report outlining the methodologies and findings is available on my ResearchGate profile:  
[**Detection of Malaria from Microscopic Images**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385817862_Detection_de_Malaria_a_partir_d'images_microscopiques).

## ðŸš€ Streamlit App Concept

### ðŸŽ¬ Full App Demo

![Example GIF](assets/malariagithubgif%20(1).gif)

### ðŸ”¬ Bringing AI to Malaria Diagnosis

This app is designed to **assist doctors** in diagnosing malaria from blood smear images using an interactive **Streamlit** interface. Developed with **custom ML tools** tailored for **Tunisian hospitals**, it adapts to real-world **microscopic imaging conditions** for accurate and reliable parasite detection.

### âš¡ How It Works

- **Upload a Blood Smear Image:** Drag and drop your sample image into the app.
- **AI-Powered Parasite Detection:** The model highlights malaria parasites with bounding boxes.
- **Smart Classification:** Each detected parasite is labeled by type.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** See instant stats, charts, and a clear infection diagnosis.

âœ… **Intuitive. Fast. Designed for medical professionals.**

## Data Collection
The dataset was gathered at the **Parasitology & Mycology Lab Center** of Charles Nicole Hospital using blood smears infected with malaria. In close collaboration with expert biologists and doctors over multiple sessions, we documented the data collection process. Images were captured with a **Canon EOS 1000D** and a **Zeiss Axiolab microscope** at **100x magnification**.

## Upcoming README Updates

**Note:** While the current technical report focuses on the core functionalities, additional features have already been implemented, including:

- **Histogram Visualization:** Displaying the frequency of various parasite types (schizonts, gametocytes, rings, and trophozoites).
- **Continuous Learning & Flagging:** A system that allows doctors to flag false predictions to continuously improve the model.
- **Uncertainty Quantification & Explainable AI (XAI):**  
  Demonstration of model explanations: the left image is a sample cell with its parasite from our dataset, and the right is its corresponding [Weight-Class Activation Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391).

Future updates to this README will include detailed documentation and usage instructions for these enhancements as the project evolves.
